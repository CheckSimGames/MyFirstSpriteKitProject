# MyFirstSpriteKitProject

A project with some simple examples of using SpriteKit. This project works with some articles on SpriteKit I wrote at [Check Sim Games](https://checksimgames.com).

The project uses the multiplatform game template with iOS and Ma targets.

## Branches

Each branch represents a stage in the project.

* The main branch has the current version of the project. When I finish the articles, it will contain the final version.
* The empty branch removes all the Apple boilerplate code that comes with the project. It provides a starting point for working with SpriteKit.
* The textured-sprite branch adds a sprite with a texture to the project.
